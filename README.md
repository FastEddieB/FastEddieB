07/22/2021 I decide to merge transparently. Fate will tell
how prudent an idea in this process THIS was. My life
is a rolling dumpster fire through a benefit performance
to honor ancestors unknown, unnamed, unacknowledged
 and expressed through myself alone as a solo entity
on this near 200k speeding centripetal, molten 
ferrous maga core wobble along through the last stages
stages of THIS chapter of humanity. Namaste to the 
Collective whom feel me. 

If you sought me out here hoping to learn some 
secret lynch pin to my psyche good luck.... the shadows
grow longer, darker and deeper daily. Without that
"necessary pain" there would be no appreciation. 
No ecclesiastes. Trees with roots deep in Niflheim
 have the highest branches reaching to Valhalla. 
Onyx, Argentum and Lapis Lazuli. 

David Boehm's theory of Holomovement. 

I've successfully lived through years of being
 a T.I. Whether I've kept my sanity or not is
 debatable. 

I've successfully survived an DEW - ADS assault 
in a public park by a clandestine paramilitary
 group in gillie suits over camouflage. The 6 I saw 
spread out from the tree line in front of me with auto-
matic weapons trained on my person. They never 
spoke. Each command was a cork popping noise
 followed by a succession of clicks. The device
 was in the shade of the treeline over 30 yards 
from where I had dropped my pack, put my arms up, 
hands out and slowly knelt and lay on the ground. 
The devices was a metal box you couldn't really see. 
What was visible was a grid of 1 in x 1in fishing line
thin prismatic refraction of light that did hit the 
DEW device. It targeted either a pin point of 
intemse pain anywhere in my upper dermal layer or a wide-
spread portion (a quarter or so) of my body with an 
ever increasing intensity of sunburn. 4 or 5 P.M. 
September 11, 2019 Brookside Park Ames, Iowa. Just
across the river probably 100 onlookers filmed the 
experience from 100 to 120 yards away. I committed no
grievance, crime or offense prior to said scenario 
other than voice my then 19 year old girl's misfortune
to whom I then thought an influential member of 
society. I sought justice, assistance and guidance 
for unthinkable, inhumane acts my family had exper-
ienced. 3 days after release from County for snacking
a man I'd warned for 6 weeks straight to leave me 
be. I represented myself. Best experience I've had to
date in a courtroom. 

What's the longest relationship I've been in? 
FastEddieB vs. The State of Iowa

When you've been left no choice but to break 
unjust laws, good men will fight to change either
 the laws or the men that made them. The enemies of man
have names, physical addresses, and M most likely
RH - bloodtypes. As you live the days foretold by 
prophets of old, embrace the Lion/ chain the dragon.
We as a race have failed the simulation EVERY
 time through fear, division and a worldly ego. 
Unity, Love and a deep personal relationship with
 the Source of All Life is the only way THROUGH. 
Tuatha D√© Danann, Tagnarok, the Apocalypse and 
man's inner spiritual battle are all perpetual
 struggles. The side we Champion in this phys
-ical life between Light and dark fuels the tide 
of battle in all realms here and now. 

....and the hereafter. 

I saw a comet burn green in the past week as it
 entered earth's upper atmosphere. Aurora Borealis
green fire trailing behind a pale stone. Instantly
I thought of Hades and Hellfire. Burning souls. 
Death riding the Pale Horse. Or Darken Rahl, his 
specters in the Underworld where he was sent by 
his son Richard Rahl, Richard Cypher,the Lord Rahl
 of D'Hara and the Master of the D'Haran Empire. 
The rightful Seeker of Truth, the first War Wizard 
to be born in over three thousand years, and was
 the husband of the Mother Confessor of all the 
Midlands, Kahlan Amnell. After being killed and 
sent to the Underworld to join The Keeper whom Darken
 Rahl followed. 

Although Darken Rahl was killed by opening the Boxes
 of Orden, his opening the Boxes allowed for a
 tear in the veil which allowed the Stone of Tears
 to be in the world. The veil is the boundary
 separating the underworld from the world of life. 
With it torn, the keeper could potentially
 consume the world and destroy all life. Richard, 
being the last war wizard in approximately 3,000 
years was the only one who could prevent this from
 happening by closing the veil. Because war wizards 
are born with both sides of the gift: additive and
 subtractive magic.

However, Richard had fallen in love with Kahlan,
 power and all, and was as such immune to her 
magic. Using the charade of being under Kahlan's
 power, Richard utilized the Wizard's First Rule
 and tricked Darken Rahl into opening the incorrect 
Box of Orden, the power of which subsequently
 destroyed him.

Eventually, Richard saved the Old and New Worlds 
from the Imperial Order, the chimes, and 
Chainfire by creating the world without magic. 

[When Darken Rahl is in the Underworld and
 projects to the liv9ng world AND when he came
 as a specter or specter's seeped through the
 veil, the effect used was a pale green hellfire. 
I think in LOTR when the Fellowship enters the 
cave and Aragorn fights the Army of the Dead, that
 same transparent, pale green is used for the
 Dead Army. 

Life imitates art imitates life. 

Familiarity, nice special effect ambiance....
mimicry, cloning, copying movements in a story-
board, cliche catch-phrases and niche sounds are 
methods used in entertainment industries, gaming, 
advertisement design and cleverly bringing a 
joke circling back to meet previous delivery are
 all part of the process of immersion.... : feel-
ing as if you are a part of the story, intently 
engrossed in the material as if a character on 
the stage... CGI and sound effects have to be by
law not a direct duplication of someone else's 
creation or work. That dancing pale green fire 
aura has been synonymous with death, spirits and
the Underworld for decades. Inuit and Greenland
eskimo tribes called Aurora Borealis the dance of
lost children; or Northern Ligjts were referenced
 as ancestors or spirits meeting in merriment. Famil-
iarity is often used to soften a viewer's percep-
tin or appeal to the masses because legend and folk-
lore already had foundations prepared. Iconography.
