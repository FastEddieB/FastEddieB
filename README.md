07/22/2021 I decide to merge transparently. Fate will tell
how prudent an idea in this process THIS was. My life
is a rolling dumpster fire through a benefit performance
to honor ancestors unknown, unnamed, unacknowledged
 and expressed through myself alone as a solo entity
on this near 200k speeding centripetal, molten 
ferrous maga core wobble along through the last stages
stages of THIS chapter of humanity. Namaste to the 
Collective whom feel me. 

If you sought me out here hoping to learn some 
secret lynch pin to my psyche good luck.... the shadows
grow longer, darker and deeper daily. Without that
"necessary pain" there would be no appreciation. 
No ecclesiastes. Trees with roots deep in  have 
the highest branches.
